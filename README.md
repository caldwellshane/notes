# Notes



## Install

`pip install notes`

## How to use

For now, the documentation is inline with the code in each notebook. Note also that examples and
tests are combined in cells that do not begin with the `#export` pragma. Both the examples and the
tests are run during CI.

## Contributing
To convert all notebooks to `.py` source files, use `nbdev_build_lib`.
