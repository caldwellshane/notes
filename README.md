# Notes



## Install

`pip install notes`

## How to use

For now, the documentation is inline with the code in each notebook. Note also that examples and
tests are combined in cells that do not begin with the `#export` pragma. Both the examples and the
tests are run during CI.

## Contributing
This project is different from a typical Python project, as it is defined in Jupyter notebooks with the support of the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) package. In this model, source code, documentation, and tests, live together in the noteboks. (In this project they are located in `src`). The regular Python modules in the deployed `notes` package is autogenerated using nbdev.

This is a personal project, and so I'm not really soliciting contributions. But the basic workflow for contributing is:
1. Make edits in the notebooks in `src`.
1. Run `nbdev_build_lib`.
1. Run `nbdev_build_docs`.
1. Commit and push.
